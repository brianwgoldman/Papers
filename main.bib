  abstract =	"Abstract This paper presents an empirical study of the
		 variation of program size over time, for a form of
		 Genetic Programming called Cartesian Genetic
		 Programming. Two main types of Cartesian genetic
		 programming are examined: one uses a fully connected
		 graph, with no redundant nodes, while the other allows
		 partial connectedness and has redundant nodes. Studies
		 are reported here for fitness based search and for a
		 flat fitness landscape. The variation of program size
		 with generation does not behave in a similar way to
		 that reported in other studies on standard Genetic
		 Programming. Depending on the form of Cartesian genetic
		 programming, it is found that there is either very weak
		 program bloat or zero bloat. It is argued that an
		 important factor in the analysis of the change of
		 program length is neutral drift, and that if genotype
		 redundancy is present, the genetic neutral drift
		 simultaneously improves search and compresses program
		 code.",

    Unlike previous work, our experiments show that CGP
    has an innate parsimony pressure that makes it very difficult
    to evolve individuals with a high percentage of active nodes.
    This bias is particularly prevalent as the length of an individual
    increases. Furthermore, these problems are compounded
    by CGP’s positional biases which can make some problems
    effectively unsolvable. Both Reorder and DAG appear to
    avoid these problems and outperform Normal CGP on preliminary

		 are inferior to the previous-best one, whereas
		 evolutionary approaches guided by the 'survival of the
		 fittest' paradigm often ignore such solutions. Trying
		 to overcome this shortcoming, we design a simple
		 genetic algorithm that first creates lambda offspring
		 from a single parent by mutation with a mutation
		 probability that is k times larger than the usual one.
		 From the best of these offspring (which often is worse
		 than the parent) and the parent itself, we generate
		 further offspring via a uniform crossover operator that
		 takes bits from the winner offspring with probability
		 1/k only. A rigorous runtime analysis proves that our
		 new algorithm for suitable parameter choices on the
		 OneMax test function class is asymptotically faster (in
		 terms of the number of fitness evaluations) than what
		 has been shown for mu +, lambda EAs. This is the first
		 time that crossover is shown to give an advantage for
		 the OneMax class that is larger than a constant factor.
		 Using a fitness-dependent choice of k and lambda, the
		 optimisation time can be reduced further to linear in

  abstract =	"Hierarchical problems represent an important class of
		 nearly decomposable problems. The concept of near
		 decomposability is central to the study of complex
		 systems. When little a priori information is available,
		 a black box problem solver is needed to optimise these
		 hierarchical problems. The solver should be able to
		 learn linkage information, and to preserve and test
		 partial solutions at different levels in the hierarchy.
		 Two well known benchmark functions, shuffled
		 Hierarchical If-And-Only-If (HIFF) and shuffled
		 Hierarchical Trap (HTRAP) functions, exemplify the
		 challenges posed by hierarchical problems. Standard
		 genetic algorithms are unable to solve these problems,
		 and specific methods, like SEAM and hBOA, have been
		 designed to address them. In this paper, we investigate
		 how the recently developed Linkage Tree Genetic
		 Algorithm (LTGA) performs on these hierarchical
		 problems. We compare LTGA with SEAM and hBOA on HIFF
		 and HTRAP functions. Results show that, although LTGA
		 is a simple algorithm compared to SEAM and hBOA, it
		 nevertheless is a very efficient, reliable, and
		 scalable algorithm for solving the randomly shuffled
		 versions of HIFF and HTRAP, two hard, hierarchical
		 problems.",

		 of LS is an understanding of the problem that allows

		 Optimisation (BBO) setting. Here we take a closer look

		 model building, a technique commonly used in
		 Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) in order
		 to increase robustness by statistically detecting and
		 exploiting regularities in the optimization problem. We
		 find, using two standardised hard BBO problems from EA
		 literature, that LS can play an important role,
		 especially in the interplay with model building in the
		 form of what has become known as substructural LS.
		 However, we also find that optimal mixing (OM), which
		 indicates that operations in a variation operator are
		 directly checked whether they lead to an improvement,

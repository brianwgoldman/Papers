Reducing Wasted Evaluations in Cartesian Genetic Programming

Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is a form of Genetic Programming (GP) where a large proportion of the genome is identifiably unused by the phenotype.  This can lead mutation to create offspring that are genotypically different but phenotypically identical, and therefore do not need to be evaluated.  We investigate theoretically and empirically the effects of avoiding these otherwise wasted evaluations, and provide evidence that doing so reduces the median number of evaluations to solve four benchmark problems, as well as reducing CGP's sensitivity to the mutation rate.  The similarity of results across the problem set in combination with the theoretical conclusions supports the general need for avoiding these unnecessary evaluations.

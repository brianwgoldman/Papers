1) You may find it useful to at least mention other representations of CGP in which the dependency of node ordering has been reduced, or even, removed.  See for example:

Cai, Xinye, Stephen L. Smith, and Andy M. Tyrrell. "Benefits of employing an implicit context representation on hardware geometry of CGP." Evolvable Systems: From Biology to Hardware. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2005. 143-154.

Smith, Stephen L., and Michael A. Lones. "Implicit context representation Cartesian genetic programming for the assessment of visuo-spatial ability." Evolutionary Computation, 2009. CEC'09. IEEE Congress on. IEEE, 2009.

Lones, Michael Adam. "Enzyme Genetic Programming: Modelling Biological Evolvability in Genetic Programming." (2003).

The above work also has relevance for the semantics representation you report Section VI.B.

2)  When comparing your results with previous publications [8], why didn't you used the same function set?  This would have made your findings less open to question (as well as your assumption on what difference it would have made) and should be easy to implement.

3) It is unfortunate that all analysis was limited to boolean problems.  Even if some of the analysis methods would be difficult to achieve, an indication of the performance of your techniques on different problem domains would not only be of considerable interest, but would also address any criticism that the results your have presented are limited to this representation.  I suggest just one or two additional experiments could demonstrate the effectiveness across other problem domains.

Typographical corrections and other minor suggestions:

Abstract:  To avoid confusion, it may be helpful to make it clear that Skip, Accumulate etc. are your invention , e.g. "which we name..."

Following are some comments to help improve the paper:

Although I am not suggesting any more work be undertaken. It would have been nice
to see more work done on harder problems. Here there was only one seriously hard problem examined (the three-bit multiplier). Analysis of another equally hard or harder problem would have been very interesting and added to the impact of the work.

The paper has focused on Boolean problems and it would be interesting to
carry out similar analysis in other domains. Of course, this remains for the future.

C. Results

"The results reported for traditional CGP and CGP using modules in [8]
for 3-bit parity required 6 times as many evaluations as Skip-Normal."

CGP with modules is expected (and results in [8] bear this out) to be more
efficient when the problems get harder (more inputs), so making comparisons
with modular CGP on 3-bit parity is of little value actually. Perhaps you
could add a qualifying remark about this?
